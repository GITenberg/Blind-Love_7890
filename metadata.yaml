description: "Blind Love was an unfinished novel by Wilkie Collins, which he left\
  \ behind on his death in 1889. It was completed by historian and novelist Sir Walter\
  \ Besant.\nCollins's novel had already begun serialization in The Illustrated London\
  \ News, even though the author had not yet completed it. (It ran from 6 July to\
  \ 28 December of that year.) When it was published in book form on 1890, the volume\
  \ included Besant's preface explaining the circumstances of the collaboration.\n\
  Collins had started writing the novel in 1887, when newspapers were full of stories\
  \ about Fenian violence in the wake of the previous year's defeat of the First Irish\
  \ Home Rule Bill. Collins frequented Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese off London's Fleet\
  \ Street and borrowed some traits for his male protagonist from John O'Connor Power\
  \ who was also well known in the convivial tavern. Collins links the Irish Question\
  \ to the Woman Question. The novel recounts the story of Lord Harry Norland, a member\
  \ of a squad of political assassins; the book's heroine is Iris Henley, a bold and\
  \ nonconformist Englishwoman who falls in love with the Irish Norland despite his\
  \ criminal activities (the \"blind love\" of the title). The title was originally\
  \ to have been Lord Harry, the colloquial name for the devil.\n\n\n From Wikipedia\
